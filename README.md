## Case Study:
The sample data of process of two machines was collected by an employee. The statistical analysis is to be performed as asked by the team leader. 

## Task 2:
The product to be manufactured has to undergo processing from 5 machines. Each machine has it's own rejection rate (highlighted in red). The monthly target is to produce 1000 finished parts. The company wants us to analyse the process and estimate the required raw material so that they can plan their inventory and supply chain.
